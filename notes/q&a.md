A2:

"It works on my machine" syndrome
Dependency conflicts between applications
Inconsistent environments across development, testing, and production
Resource inefficiency of traditional VMs
Complex application deployment and scaling

Q3: What are the key benefits of containerization?
A3:

Consistent environments across development and production
Isolation of applications and dependencies
Efficient resource utilization
Quick start-up and deployment
Easy scaling and updates
